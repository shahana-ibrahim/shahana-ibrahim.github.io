I am a PhD Candidate at the [School of EECS, Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/), advised by [Dr. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia/). My research focus is in designing provable and efficient methods for various data-driven tasks in machine learning. I also work in the fields of signal processing and optimization with applications of various structured factorization tools and related algorithm design.

Before joining PhD, I had interned with the GPU team at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), Santa Clara, USA in 2018 and had been working as a System Validation Engineer with [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/), Bengaluru, India, from 2012 to 2017.

***Currently, I am available in the job market and actively looking for full time positions!***

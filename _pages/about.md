I am a PhD Candidate at the [School of EECS, Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/). My broad research interests are in the fields of machine learning and data science, with focus on designing provable learning methods for effective utilization of real-world data. I also work at the intersection of signal processing and optimization with applications of various structured factorization tools in data mining and related algorithm design.

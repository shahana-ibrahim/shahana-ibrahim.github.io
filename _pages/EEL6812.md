## Description

This course introduces the basics of neural networks and deep learning in a rigorous way. The aim is to open doors to the vast world of deep learning, understand its strengths, challenges, potential risks, usefulness to the humankind for a wide spectrum of applications. In addition, the students are expected to grasp the fundamentals in designing a deep learning model and learn to adapt it for their own research purposes. The course materials would be designed accordingly such that deep learning research in multidisciplinary domains are benefitted.
